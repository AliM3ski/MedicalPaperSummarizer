## Methods Summary

**Study Design**: In vitro experimental study comparing RGD peptide-coated Ti6Al4V alloy scaffolds (FTA) versus uncoated controls (CTA).

**Material Preparation**: Ti6Al4V alloy scaffolds (5 mm × 5 mm) were obtained from hip joint prosthesis surfaces. RGD peptides were synthesized and labeled with FITC. FTA scaffolds were prepared through covalent conjunction: immersion in 10% (w/v) 1,6-hexanediamine for 60 min at 37°C, followed by 2 mg/mL sulfo-SMCC solution for 1 h at room temperature, then 0.1 mg/mL RGD peptide solution for 12 h at 37°C.

**Cell Culture**: Primary osteoblasts were isolated from mouse femora and tibia using 300 active U/mL collagenase digestion. Passage 2 cells were seeded at 3.0 × 10⁵ cells/cm² density on both scaffold groups.

**Primary Endpoints**: 
- Cell distribution and number (7 hours post-seeding)
- Cell morphology (24 hours)
- Osteogenic gene expression of ALP and COL1 (7 days)

**Key Procedures**: Confocal microscopy for RGD detection (488 nm/525 nm), cell distribution via Hoechst staining (360 nm/460 nm), morphology assessment using rhodamine phalloidin (488 nm/517 nm), and real-time qPCR using Applied Biosystems 7300 with 2^(-ΔΔCt) method.

**Statistical Analysis**: All experiments performed in triplicate, analyzed using Student's t-test with SPSS 19 software. Results expressed as mean ± standard deviation, with P<0.05 considered statistically significant.

## Key Findings
1. Green fluorescence of FTA was even, demonstrating successful and homogeneous conjugation of FITC-labeled RGD onto Ti6Al4V alloy
2. More osteoblasts adhered to FTA scaffolds compared to CTA scaffolds after 7 hours of incubation
3. Student's t-test showed cell number in FTA groups was significantly higher than CTA group (P < 0.05)
4. Osteoblasts in FTA group exhibited better spreading morphology than CTA group based on cytoskeletal staining with rhodamine phalloidin
5. After 7-day incubation, more ALP and COL1 genes were expressed in FTA group than CTA group

## Limitations
1. Specific biological mechanism requires comprehensive analysis in future studies
2. Further in vivo experiments necessary to test biological effects of FTA scaffolds

## Author Conclusions
Based on the discussion/conclusion section provided, the authors' explicitly stated conclusions are:

The authors conclude that RGD oligopeptide was successfully covalently conjugated onto Ti6Al4V alloy to create functional Ti6Al4V alloy (FTA) with even and homogeneous distribution, and that FTA scaffolds demonstrated superior performance for osteoblast adhesion and spreading with improved osseointegration properties. The authors conclude that FTA scaffolds provide a pathway for designing more efficient prostheses for osseointegration between host bone and prosthesis in revision total hip arthroplasty.
